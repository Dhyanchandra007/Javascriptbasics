1. Core JavaScript Concepts:

Data Types: Understanding primitive data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt) and object types.
var, let, and const: Differences in scope (global, function, block) and re-declaration/re-assignment.
Hoisting: Explaining how variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.
Scope and Closures: Understanding lexical scoping and how closures allow access to outer function's scope from inner functions.
this keyword: Explaining its dynamic nature and how its value is determined by the calling context.
Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance: Understanding how objects inherit properties and methods in JavaScript.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await: Handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
Event Loop: Understanding how JavaScript manages asynchronous tasks and the execution order of code.
2. DOM Manipulation and Event Handling:

DOM (Document Object Model): How JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.
Event Handling: Attaching event listeners and handling user interactions (clicks, keypresses, form submissions).
Event Bubbling vs. Event Capturing: Understanding event propagation.
3. ES6+ Features:

Arrow Functions: Syntax and this binding differences compared to regular functions.
Destructuring: Extracting values from arrays and objects.
Spread and Rest Operators: Their usage in various scenarios.
Modules: Organizing and importing/exporting JavaScript code.
4. Advanced Topics:

Functional Programming Concepts: Pure functions, function composition, immutability.
Error Handling: Using try...catch and other error management techniques.
Performance Optimization: Tips for writing efficient JavaScript code.
Debugging Techniques: Tools and methods for identifying and resolving issues.
5. Coding Challenges:

Array Manipulation: Sorting, filtering, mapping, reducing arrays.
String Manipulation: Reversing strings, checking for palindromes, converting case.
Algorithm Implementations: Factorial, Fibonacci sequence, prime number checks.

6. Framework/Library Specific Questions (if applicable):

React Hooks: If the role involves React, questions about useState, useEffect, etc.
Specific Framework Concepts: Questions related to Angular, Vue, etc., depending on the job requirements.
