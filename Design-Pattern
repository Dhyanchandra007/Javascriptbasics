üß© What Are Micro-Frontends?
Micro-frontends divide a large frontend application into smaller, independently developed and deployed modules. Each module (or "micro-frontend") is typically owned by a separate team and handles a specific feature or section of the UI‚Äîlike a login form, product catalog, or shopping cart.

Think of it like assembling a digital Lego set: each team builds a piece, and those pieces come together to form a cohesive user experience.

‚úÖ Pros of Micro-Frontends
Independent Deployability Each module can be built, tested, and deployed separately, reducing bottlenecks and improving fault isolation.

Team Autonomy Teams can work independently, choose their own tech stack (React, Vue, Angular, etc.), and follow their own development cycles.

Scalability Applications can scale horizontally by adding more micro-frontends, and each module can be scaled independently.

Faster Time to Market Parallel development and deployment allow for quicker feature rollouts. For example, Spotify saw a 40% reduction in rollout time using this approach.

Tech Agnosticism Teams aren‚Äôt locked into a single framework or library, which improves hiring flexibility and future-proofing.

Cost Efficiency Cloud-native deployment of individual modules can reduce infrastructure costs and optimize resource usage.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons of Micro-Frontends
Complex Governance Ensuring consistent UI/UX, accessibility, and compliance across modules requires strict governance and coordination.

Orchestration Overhead Managing how modules are loaded and interact can require additional tooling and effort, such as a shell app or orchestration layer.

State Management Challenges Sharing and syncing state across modules can be tricky and may lead to bugs or security issues if not handled properly.

Performance Concerns Multiple frameworks and duplicated dependencies can bloat the final bundle and affect performance.

Increased Initial Complexity Setting up infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and communication protocols for micro-frontends is more complex than a monolithic frontend.

üß† When to Use Micro-Frontends
  Micro-frontends shine in large-scale applications with multiple teams, frequent deployments, and diverse tech needs.
  But for smaller projects, the overhead might outweigh the benefits.
